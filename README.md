# GO-Training <br>
This repository is made for people with background in Go who also do coding in other langauges and would like to check some of the things that they may forget, all in one place :D. <br>
Here's a breif introduction of the repository, a more through one will be added later : <br>
1-scopes : you have examples of different types of scopes and closure and blocks and how scoping works in golang <br>
2-variables : how you can initialize variables and use blank identifiers <br>
3-pointers : how pointers and variables work in golang and how function arguments are used in golang <br>
Keep in mind that most of the credit should go to https://github.com/GoesToEleven/golang-web-dev and https://github.com/GoesToEleven/GolangTraining and his great courses, I just organized the content in a way that was more suiting for someone with background in programming. 

ps. work in progress <br>
